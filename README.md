# Ranged Wireless Redstone
Ranged Wireless Redstone is a forge mod for Minecraft that adds redstone transmitters and recievers allowing redstone signals to be transmitted wirelessly over a limited (configurable) distance.

## Tiny Redstone Support
When [Tiny Redstone](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tiny-redstone "Tiny Redstone") is also installed, this mod adds tiny redstone transmitters and recievers with a smaller range which can be placed on Tiny Redstone panels as part of tiny redstone circuits.
